# DRAW C++
Just a simple drawing program to pass the time :)

### *Before READingME*
I'm writing this so I can make it public. Maybe in the future I'll put everything in order, but at the moment this will be a bit of a mess (for as long as I'm that lazy).

## Brief tutorial
- Left click to create a circle
- Hold and release mouse right button to create a rectangle
- Mouse wheel to increase and decrease circle's radius
- Ctrl + Z to undo
- Ctrl + Y to redo
- Press C to clear the canvas
- Escape to exit the program
- Press H to open the tutorial window

## Contributing 
You're free to contribute, but I don't guarantee I'll add your features.

Try to stick to the style of the code (camel case, place of the functions, order, etc.).

Maybe, I'll create a document with a list of features I'd like to add so you can focus on something. At the moment I'm writing this isn't any list.

The same way as the feature list, at the moment I haven't done any document for guidelines. Maybe in a future I add one.

## Building
To build just use CMake. I don't know how it works, so I can't help much here. It works in debian system, and I'm trying to make it work in Windows, but I haven't made it work.

Please, build it in `build/` folder.

## Note
This project is using SFML library. Here I leave the [SFML main page](https://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php) if you need to download it or read its documentation.
